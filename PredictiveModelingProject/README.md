# Analysis and Prediction of Rideshare Prices Using Data-Driven Modeling
For this project, I executed end-to-end strategic planning and analysis of 700k rideshare records that contained data about price, ride type, source, destination, time, and weather.

## What it does
After analyzing all the variables available, I identified which had that strongest relationship to price and created a predictive model to forecast future prices.

## How it works
Using a combination of descriptive and inferential statistics to uncover relationships between variables, I ultimately created a multivariate linear regression to model and predict prices.
This analysis was completed using Tableau and Excel.

## Why I made it
While weather variables within this data set did not reveal any strong correlations to price, other factors such as ride type, distance, and certain sources and destinations did.
With these, my model predicted prices with <1% error and could be used to help companies employ strategic pricing strategies and demand forecasting.
